## Task # 2 - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

### Predicting Test Data :
| Number | Hours | Actual Scores | Predicted Scores |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  5 | 3.5 | 30  | 36.85324 |
| 11 | 7.7 | 85 | 76.02682 |
| 16 | 8.9 | 95 | 87.21927 |
| 20 | 7.4 | 69 | 73.22871 |
| 24 | 6.9 | 76 | 68.56519 |
